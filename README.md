# 📱 React Bottom Sheet Assignment

This project is built as part of a company assignment. The goal was to build a custom bottom sheet in React with snap points and spring motion-style animation – without using any third-party animation libraries like react-spring-bottom-sheet.

## 🚀 Features

- Custom Bottom Sheet component using React
- Three snap points: Closed (hidden), Half-Open, and Fully Open
- Smooth animations using only requestAnimationFrame
- Users can control the sheet using drag gestures and buttons
- Icons and content added to make it visually clear
- Fully responsive for both desktop and mobile devices

## 🛠️ How I Ran the Project

To build and run this project locally, I followed these steps:

1. First, I created the React app using:

npx create-react-app react-bottom-sheet

2. Then I added my own component BottomSheet.js and styles.

3. I installed all required packages:

npm install

4. To run the app:

npm start

5. Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:3000  
There you can interact with the Bottom Sheet.
